In Python, the `f` before a string enclosed in single or double quotes, as in `f'some text here'` or `f"some text here"`, is used to create an f-string, which stands for "formatted string." F-strings are a feature introduced in Python 3.6 that allow you to embed expressions and variables inside string literals, making string formatting more concise and readable.

The key feature of an f-string is the ability to include expressions enclosed in curly braces `{}` within the string. These expressions are evaluated at runtime and their values are inserted into the string. Here's an example to illustrate how f-strings work:

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30

# Using an f-string to format a string
message = f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old."

print(message)
```

Output:
```
My name is Alice and I am 30 years old.
```

In the example above, the `f` before the string indicates that it's an f-string. Inside the string, the expressions `{name}` and `{age}` are replaced with the values of the variables `name` and `age` at runtime.

F-strings are very convenient for creating formatted strings in Python, and they make it easy to embed variables and expressions within your text. They are often used for printing messages, formatting output, and constructing SQL queries, among other tasks.
